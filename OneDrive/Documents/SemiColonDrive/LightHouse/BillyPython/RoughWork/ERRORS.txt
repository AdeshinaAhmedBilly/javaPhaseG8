ERRORS

Task 1

The error you're encountering happens because you have a file named random.py in your project directory, which shadows the standard library random module. When you try to import random, Python loads your local random.py file instead of the built-in random module, causing the error you're seeing.

To fix this:

Rename your random.py file to something else, such as my_random.py or another descriptive name.
After renaming the file, make sure to delete any associated random.pyc or __pycache__ directories in your project folder to avoid conflicts.
Try running your script again.
This should resolve the issue and allow you to access the random.randint function from the standard library.
